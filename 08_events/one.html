    All browser activities are handled within <script> tags.

    Approach 1:
    You can add the onclick attribute directly in the HTML, like in an image tag with something like 
    onclick="alert('Hello!')" to trigger an alert when clicked. However, this method isn't the best practice because 
    it mixes HTML and JavaScript.

    A better way is to write the JavaScript separately inside a <script> tag. For example, you can target an element by 
    its ID and assign an onclick function to it like 
    document.getElementById('owl').onclick = function() { alert('Owl clicked!') }.

    Approach 2:
    The preferred approach is to use addEventListener(), which provides more flexibility. This method allows you 
    to add multiple event listeners to the same element or remove them later. For instance, you can use 
    document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener('click', function() { alert('Owl clicked with addEventListener!') });
    The first argument is the event type (e.g., 'click'), the second is the callback function, and the third is 
    a boolean flag that controls event propagation.

    If the third argument is false (default), the event will bubble. If set to true, the event will be captured 
    in the capturing phase.

    Event Propagation:
    Events propagate in two phases:
    1. Bubbling (default): The event propagates from the target (inner element) outward to its ancestors (outer elements). 
       For example, when you click on a <li> inside a <ul>, the event will bubble up from the <li> to the <ul>.
    2. Capturing: The event propagates from the outermost element to the innermost (target). You can set the third 
       parameter of addEventListener() to true to enable this phase.

    To stop an event from propagating further, use event.stopPropagation().

    Preventing Default Behavior:
    Sometimes you want to prevent the default behavior of an event, such as preventing a link from navigating. 
    This can be done by calling event.preventDefault(). For example, if you don't want a link to open a webpage, 
    event.preventDefault() will stop that from happening.

    Common Event Properties:
    - type: The event type, such as 'click', 'submit', etc.
    - target: The element that triggered the event.
    - currentTarget: The element the event listener is attached to.
    - clientX and clientY: Mouse coordinates relative to the viewport.
    - altKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey: Boolean values indicating if the corresponding key was pressed.
    - keyCode: The key code of the key that was pressed (for keyboard events).

    Event Bubbling vs. Capturing:
    - Bubbling: The event goes from the inner element outward to the outer elements.
    - Capturing: The event goes from the outermost element inward to the target element.

    The default behavior is bubbling, but you can prevent bubbling by using stopPropagation() or control it using 
    addEventListener() with the third parameter.
